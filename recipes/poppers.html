            <ul>
                <li>1- 8 ounce block of softened cream cheese</li>
                <li>1-1/2 cups shredded pepper jack cheese </li>
                <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Fresh cracked black pepper</li>
                <li>12 jalepeños</li>
                <li>12 slices of bacon, halved</li>
                <li>toothpicks, soaked in water</li>
                <li>Your favorite bbq rub</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat grill to around 350 degrees</li>
                <li>Prep the peppers by slicing in half lengthwise, use a spoon to remove the seeds and white membrane (or if you like more heat you can leave as much of the seeds and membrane you'd like).</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, shredded cheese, and any other desired seasonings you'd like.</li>
                <li>Fill each jalepeño half with the cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Wrap each filled jalepeño half with a piece of bacon and secure it with a soaked toothpick.</li>
                <li>Place poppers on the grill in indirect heat and cook for about 20-25 minutes. Toward the last few minutes you can move them to direct heat to get a nice char.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, let cool, and enjoy!</li>
