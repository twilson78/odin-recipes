                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>3 lb. chicken wings, flats, and drumettes separated</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment. Place a wire rack in sheet.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine lemon zest, baking powder, pepper, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Pat wings dry and transfer to a large bowl. Add oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle lemon zest mixture over and toss again to coat. Arrange wings on prepared rack, spacing so they do not touch.</li>
                <li>Bake wings until crispy and browned, 40 to 50 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the wings cook, in a small pot over medium heat, cook butter and honey, stirring, until honey is dissolved into butter, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Let wings cool slightly. Transfer to a clean large bowl. Drizzle lemon butter over, then toss well to coat.</li>
                <li>Arrange wings on a platter. Serve with lemon wedges and choice of dipping sauce alongside.</li>
